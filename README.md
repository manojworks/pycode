# Sample Python Code

*Sorted Insert*

Take in numbers as input until “stop” is entered. As you take in each number, insert it into a list so that the list is sorted in ascending order. That is, look through the list until you find the place where the new element belongs, then use .insert() to place it there. If the number is already in the list, do not add it again. After “stop” is entered, print out the list. Do not use any of Python’s built-in sorting functions.

*Frequency of letters*

Write a program that reads a file and prints the letters in decreasing order of frequency. Your program should convert all the input to lower case and only count the letters a-z. Your program should not count spaces, digits, punctuation, or anything other than the letters a-z. Find text samples from several different languages and see how letter frequency varies between languages. Compare your results with the tables at [wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequencies](wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequencies)
